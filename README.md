# Gaussian process based Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains code to run Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on GP based surrogate models
The codes uses the GPyTorch and BoTorch libraries. While the BoTorch has functions and classes for
implementing BO, this library contains settings and models that I found to be useful in practice
and in my research.

## Installation instructions

Clone/download the repository and use pip to install from the local directory.

```{bash}
cd <path_to_directory>
pip install .
```
